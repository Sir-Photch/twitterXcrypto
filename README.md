Tool initially intended to analyze influencers impact on crypto prices

For now, it receives twitter-posts of given twitter-users, and archives them in a database. Additionally, each tweet is searched for krypto-keywords, and, if some are found, it is posted to a discord channel with the current price and 1h-change of the specific crypto.
